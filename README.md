# Data Engineering with AWS and Rust

This repository is dedicated to practicing and learning data engineering on AWS using the Rust programming language. The goal is to build efficient, safe, and reliable data processing pipelines while leveraging the unique features of Rust and the powerful tools provided by AWS.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the examples in this repository, you should have:

- Basic understanding of Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)
- Basic understanding of AWS services for data engineering (such as S3, Glue, Lambda, and Kinesis)
- AWS CLI installed and configured (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- Rust installed (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific topic or AWS service.

- `s3_examples`: Examples demonstrating how to interact with Amazon S3 using Rust.
- `glue_examples`: Examples demonstrating how to use AWS Glue for ETL processes with Rust.
- `lambda_examples`: Examples demonstrating how to create AWS Lambda functions using Rust.
- `kinesis_examples`: Examples demonstrating how to work with Amazon Kinesis streams using Rust.
- `common`: Common utilities and helper functions shared across examples.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/augustine0890/data-engineering-aws-rust.git
